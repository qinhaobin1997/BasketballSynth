## Overview
A simulation environment for generating 3D human pose data of basketball players, built with Unreal Engine 5.

### Background
In the basketball domain, 3D pose datasets are extremely scarce, making it difficult to analyze player movements and to train data-hungry AI models.

### Approach
The environment is designed to reproduce complex pose variations observed in real games using an Unreal Engine 5 simulation pipeline.  
It enables large-scale generation of diverse 3D pose data that is difficult to capture from real matches, supporting improved model training and more advanced motion analysis.
