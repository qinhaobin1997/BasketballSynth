## Overview
I developed a simulation environment to generate **3D human pose data** for basketball players, built with Unreal Engine 5.

### Background
In the basketball domain, **3D pose datasets are extremely scarce**, which makes it difficult to analyze player movements and to train data-hungry AI models.

### What I did
To address this, I focused on the complex pose variations that occur during real games and built a basketball simulation environment in Unreal Engine 5 to reproduce them.  
This enables large-scale generation of diverse 3D pose data that is hard to collect from real matches, and can potentially improve AI model performance and support more advanced motion analysis.
